If you are interested in learning how to recreate this game entirely from scratch, you can find a detailed walk through in the book [Pro HTML5 Games](http://www.adityaravishankar.com/pro-html5-games/).

In the process of creating this game, we look at building the splash screen, game menu, levels, an asset loader, sound and music.

We also take a detailed look at the Box2DWeb engine and how to use the engine to manage the game physics.
